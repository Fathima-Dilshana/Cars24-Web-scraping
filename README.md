OBJECTIVE

The objective for this web scraping project involved several key steps to ensure the successful extraction and analysis of data. First, the project utilized Python as the primary programming language due to its extensive libraries and ease of use for web scraping tasks. Essential libraries included BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and extracting data, and Requests for sending HTTP requests and retrieving web content. Additionally, Selenium was employed to manage dynamic content and automate interactions with web pages that used JavaScript for data loading. The implementation process began with setting up the development environment and installing the necessary libraries. The web scraper was designed to navigate through the target website and extract specific data fields, such as product names, prices, and reviews. BeautifulSoup was used to parse the HTML content and retrieve the desired information, while Requests facilitated the fetching of web pages. To address the challenges of dynamic content loading, Selenium was incorporated to interact with elements that were not immediately visible on page load. This approach allowed the scraper to handle JavaScript-generated content effectively. The project also included mechanisms for managing anti-scraping measures, such as CAPTCHAs and IP blocking. Techniques like implementing delays between requests, using proxy servers, and handling CAPTCHA challenges were employed to ensure smooth and uninterrupted data collection. 
Data was then structured and saved in CSV and JSON formats to facilitate further 
analysis. Error handling and data validation procedures were integrated to maintain 
the quality and accuracy of the collected information. The methodology aimed to 
create a reliable and efficient web scraping tool capable of handling various 
challenges and producing valuable data for analysis. 
This structured approach ensured that the web scraper was robust, effective, and 
capable of addressing both technical and practical challenges encountered during 
the project.
