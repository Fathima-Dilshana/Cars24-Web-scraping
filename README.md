WEB SCRAPING OF CARS24.COM

This is a project report of the project , which we (Team E) of EVOASTRA VENTURES pvt ltd has done as part of our internship program. The main aim of this project is to web scrap the data of the website "cars24.com" . The data's we need to scrap are details of used cars in various locations enlisted in the website for re-selling. The details we have to extract for each cars are
1. Year
2. Make
3. Model
4. Kilometers driven
5. Fuel type
6. Ownership
7. Transmission type
8. Current price
9. Original price
10. Location

After extracting data, we cleaned the data and treated the missing values & duplicate values. After this, we performed a Power Bi visualization for the extracted data's and discovered several insights. 

In addition, we developed a predictive analysis model to predict the price of the car with the features mentioned.

Here, I added python file, project report pdf, presentation file and power bi visualization file.
